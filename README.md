---
This repository is the project assignment of course, Engineering Numerical Simulation in Dept of CS, Meiji University, 2019.

The program launches with main.py

You can select window, and crop some area of that window, then can translate the text in that area.

It recognizes text using tesseract, and translate texts to desired language using googletrans.

i checked it works with googletrans4.0.0
